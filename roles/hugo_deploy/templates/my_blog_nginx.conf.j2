# Nginx Server Block Configuration for Hugo Site
#
# This file would typically be placed at: /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-blog
# And then enabled via a symbolic link:
# sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-blog /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/my-blog
# (In most cases, you will remove a default file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.)

# Remember to test configuration: sudo nginx -t
# And reload Nginx to apply changes: sudo systemctl reload nginx
